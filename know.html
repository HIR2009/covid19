<h3>
    Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 
    <br>
    <br>
    The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China in December of 2019.
    <br>
    <br>
    The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic.
<br>
<br>
    Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste.
    <br>
    <br>
    Symptoms may begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms.
    <br>
    <br>
    Of those people who develop noticeable symptoms enough to be classed as patients, most (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms 
    <br>
    (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), and 5% suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction).
    <br>
    <br>
    Older people are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms. Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed.
    <br>
    <br>
    Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.
